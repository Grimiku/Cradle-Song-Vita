# Cradle Song Teaser (PS Vita port)
A Cradle Song Teaser port for Playstation Vita console leveraging [Ren'Py Vita](https://github.com/SonicMastr/renpy-vita) by [SonicMastr](https://github.com/SonicMastr).

## Requirements
* Modded PS Vita (very easy to search for loading CFW online)
* [VitaShell](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/VitaShell) or any other method of navigating Vita's internal memory

## Installation 
### First Time
1. Go into **Releases** section of this depository and download the _.vpk_ file
2. Transfer the file into your Vita (ie. under _ux0:VPK_ or any other folder you created) and install

The installation can take a up to 1 min 30 secs and so does the first startup of the game. Subsequent startups go from zero to operational in around 53-57 sec. All of this is expected behaviour so far.

### Updating
1. Go into **Releases** section of this depository and download the _**data.rpa**_ file
2. Go into **_ux0:app/CDRSLV098/game_** and replace existing data.rpa with the downloaded one

## Changelog
### Initial Release - v00.98
